# How to retrieve data

We follow prior work in the few-shot learning literature to retrieve task-relevant images from VLM's publicly available pretraining dataset LAION-400M.

We attach the link to the work here: [retrieval instructions](https://github.com/tian1327/SWAT/blob/master/retrieval/RETRIEVAL.md).
